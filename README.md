So the problem is there is no native way to get cursor position in element,
even with jQuery and something/
so let's implement this in own system/browser and won't mind current broken web.

The other things is: use shadow dom to add aka time elements in document,
store all data in css with Rust and wasm and use js to just work on the front staff.
